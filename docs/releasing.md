# Releasing Pica Pica

Preview releases are built only from immutable Git tags matching `v*-preview.*`.

## Before tagging

1. Keep the version identical in `package.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, and `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`.
2. Run `pnpm check`.
3. Run Rust formatting, Clippy, and tests from `src-tauri`.
4. Merge the release preparation through a green pull request.
5. Create a new tag such as `v0.1.0-preview.1` on the verified `main` commit. Never move or reuse a published tag.

The Preview Release workflow rejects a tag whose base version does not match all three application manifests.

## Published files

The workflow builds and attaches:

- a Windows x64 NSIS installer;
- a Linux x64 AppImage;
- `SHA256SUMS.txt` covering both installers.

Each installer contains the pinned FFmpeg and ffprobe build, its upstream notices, and the local provenance record. The workflow verifies the downloaded FFmpeg archive before packaging.

## Signing status

Preview packages are currently unsigned. Windows may show a SmartScreen warning. Do not publish a stable release until the signing and release-key process is documented and tested.
